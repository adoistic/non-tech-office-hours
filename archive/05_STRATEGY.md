# 05 — Strategy (not Planning)

This is the phase the founder will be most tempted to skip. Don't let them.

This phase is **stricter** than any other in this session about *coherence* — but **more forgiving** than any other about *certainty*. The founder will produce a real bet, not a list of activities, and they will not be asked to prove the bet will work. They will only be asked to articulate it clearly and to back up every choice with logic.

## Strategy is not planning

Most founders — including most non-technical ones — confuse these two. The cost of confusion is high: you spend two years executing a plan that was never going to win, while a competitor with an actual strategy quietly takes the market.

The distinction (Roger Martin):

> A strategy is an integrative set of choices that positions you on a playing field of your choice in a way that you win.

A **plan** is a list of activities — hire X, build Y, launch Z, improve customer experience, open a new channel. Plans are *comfortable* because they are about resources and costs (which you control). Plans do not have to be coherent, and most aren't.

A **strategy** specifies an *outcome* — a competitive outcome that depends on customer behavior (which you don't control). It feels riskier because you can't prove it in advance. That is the point. The angst is a feature.

Martin's bottom line:

> If you plan, that's a way to guarantee losing. If you do strategy, it gives you the best possible chance of winning.

## Playing to play vs. playing to win

The major US air carriers were busy "planning what routes to fly," buying more planes, opening more gates. They were not trying to *win* against each other on any specific field.

Then Southwest came along with a strategy:

- **Winning aspiration:** be a substitute for Greyhound — a way more convenient way to get around at a price not extraordinarily higher than a bus.
- **Where to play:** short flights, point-to-point, secondary airports.
- **How to win:** lowest cost in the industry, by far.
- **Capabilities:** one aircraft type (737), no meals on short flights, online direct booking instead of travel agents, fast gate turnaround.
- **Management systems:** every activity reinforces every other. 737-only means cheaper training, cheaper maintenance, cheaper gate setup. Point-to-point means no hub overhead. No meals means faster turns. Direct booking means lower customer acquisition cost.

Every choice fits with every other choice. That is the *integrative* part of an integrative set of choices.

Most early startups are not Southwest. Almost no early startups bother to write down what their Southwest move actually is. This phase is where the founder writes it down.

## The five strategic choices

The founder must produce a clear answer to each of these five. Not eventually. Today. In the chat. In plain English. Each one is a *choice* — meaning something else was rejected.

### 1. Winning Aspiration
What does winning look like for this company, specifically? Not "be a great company." Not "make customers happy." Something concrete: *"be the substitute for [specific existing behavior] for [specific customer segment] within [time horizon]."*

The aspiration is the destination. It anchors every other choice.

### 2. Where to Play
What playing field has been chosen — and which playing fields have been *explicitly ruled out*?

A where-to-play choice is made along multiple dimensions:
- Which customer segment (be specific — a real human, as in Q3, scaled up)
- Which geography
- Which channels (where the customer finds out you exist)
- Which stage of the value chain
- Which product category — and which adjacent categories you are *not* in

If the founder cannot name what they are *not* doing, they have not made a where-to-play choice.

### 3. How to Win
Given the playing field, what is the founder's *right to win* against everyone else who is or could be on that same field?

The traditional frame: cost leadership, or differentiation. **In an AI-native world, this question has new candidates and one disqualified answer.**

**Disqualified answer:** "We'll write more code than them." Lines of code is no longer a moat. AI has collapsed software production cost by 10-100x. Code is now cheap to produce, so the moat of having a lot of it is gone (see `02_AI_NATIVE_CONTEXT.md` — The Defensibility Shift). If the founder says "our edge is we'll out-build them," reject it.

**Equally disqualified:** "We have AI." So does everyone else with a credit card. AI is a substrate, not a strategy. What does *your use of AI* let you do that a competitor with the same access can't?

**Real candidates** the founder must pick from (one or more):

- **Cost leadership** — genuinely lowest cost in the segment, by design choice not luck.
- **Closed-loop data flywheel** — your queryable operations produce proprietary data that makes the product smarter over time. Competitors without the loop fall behind release by release.
- **Distribution** — you reach the customer through a channel competitors can't or won't replicate.
- **Trust / regulatory access** — particularly powerful in regulated incumbent-attacking categories (healthcare, finance, defense). Hard to clone with any amount of compute.
- **Network effects** — multi-sided platform, marketplace, or community where the product is more valuable as more participants join.
- **Proprietary data** — sensors, partnerships, customer-side integrations producing data only you have access to.
- **Depth of workflow integration** — once you live inside the customer's daily workflow, switching cost is high even if your code can be cloned cheaply.
- **Speed of iteration** — a token-maxed, software-factory-running team genuinely iterates faster. The compounding wins.

A good how-to-win sounds like:

> Compliance officers at mid-market healthcare companies will choose us because we are the only product that pre-fills the HIPAA audit forms automatically from existing patient records, which saves them roughly 30 hours a quarter and means they don't have to hire a second compliance analyst. No competitor does this because the integration with the major EMRs requires a 9-month sales cycle we have already completed.

That level of specificity. If the founder cannot give you that, they don't have a how-to-win. They have a wish.

### 4. Capabilities Required
What specific capabilities must this company have to deliver on the how-to-win? Not a generic list. The ones that are *essential* and *hard to copy*.

Southwest's list looks short but is lethally specific: one aircraft type, fast gate turnaround, direct online booking, point-to-point operations. Each capability supports the others. Take one out and the cost advantage collapses.

The non-technical founder owns *naming* the capabilities. The technical co-founder owns *building* them. But if the founder cannot name them, the co-founder is building blind.

**For AI-native startups, capabilities tend to be drawn from this list:**

- Closed-loop ingestion + queryable artifact store
- Software-factory build pipeline (spec → tests → AI-generated implementation)
- Specific data partnerships or integrations
- Customer trust / brand within a specific regulated segment
- Token-budget management and AI cost discipline
- The founder's domain network or sales access
- A specific workflow integration that creates switching cost

Pick the ones that actually serve the how-to-win. Don't list everything that sounds important.

### 5. Management Systems
What systems must be in place to develop, support, and measure these capabilities? What gets tracked weekly? What metric tells you the strategy is working? What metric tells you it isn't?

For an early-stage startup, "management systems" is often just two or three things: the weekly customer conversation cadence, the one metric that gets watched, the meeting where the decision to keep going gets made. Name them.

**For AI-native companies, the closed-loop ops decisions are management systems.** See `02_AI_NATIVE_CONTEXT.md` for the prescriptions (AI notetakers, channels over DMs, dashboards from week one). These land in `FOR_YOUR_CO_FOUNDER.md` as concrete choices the co-founder has to know about and build for.

## The "back it up all of it" gate

This is the strict gate, and it is non-negotiable.

For every strategic choice — winning aspiration, where to play, how to win, each capability, each system — the founder must articulate *what would have to be true* for that choice to be the right one. Five buckets:

| Bucket | The question |
| --- | --- |
| About us | What does our team / story / capability set need to be true about for us to actually execute this? |
| About the industry | What does the broader industry / category need to be true about for this to be a real opportunity? |
| About competition | What does competitor behavior need to be true about — what they're doing, not doing, blind to, or unable to do? |
| About customers | What does customer behavior need to be true about — what they value, what they will pay, how they will buy? |
| **About our production economics** | What does our AI-native build environment need to be true about for us to actually ship and iterate at the speed we're claiming? Does our token-maxing position hold up at scale? Is the software factory we're relying on actually as productive as we're assuming? |

The fifth bucket is new. It exists because in an AI-native world, your assumptions about how fast and cheap production is are themselves a bet — and the bet can be wrong. If you assume your co-founder ships in 2 weeks because of the software factory, and the factory turns out to need 6 months of tooling investment first, the whole strategy is off.

For each "what must be true" item, also ask: **how would we know if it is not true?** That is the signal. That is how the strategy stays alive instead of becoming a plan in disguise.

Martin again:

> Lay out the logic of your strategy clearly. What would have to be true about ourselves, about the industry, about competition, about customers for this strategy to work? It'll allow you to tweak your strategy. Strategy is a journey.

If the founder cannot articulate what must be true behind a choice, the choice is not yet a choice — it's a guess wearing a hat. Push them to back it up, or remove it from the strategy.

---

## The strict / forgiving balance

### Stricter than any other phase

- **No "we'll figure it out"** on any of the five choices.
- **No vague aspirations.** "Be a great company" is not an aspiration. "Win the SMB compliance market in healthcare in 18 months by being the only product that auto-fills HIPAA forms" is.
- **No "better UX" / "AI-powered" / "more focused"** as how-to-win. Specific, comparative, customer-grounded — or nothing.
- **No "we'll out-code them"** as how-to-win. Lines of code is no longer a moat.
- **No fluffy capabilities.** Each one essential, hard to copy, and named.
- **No skipping the "what must be true" backup.** Every choice gets backed up. Every one. All five buckets.
- **No activities masquerading as strategy.** "Hire two salespeople" is not strategy. It might appear in an operational to-do list. It does not appear in the strategy doc unless the founder can back it up with a strategic bet.

### More forgiving than any other phase

- **You do not require the founder to prove the strategy will work.** They can't. That is true of every strategy ever written. Saying "I cannot prove this" is not a defect.
- **You do not require certainty.** Strategy is a bet. The angst is real, and the founder should feel it.
- **You do not require the strategy to be final.** Strategy is a journey. Lay out the logic, watch the world unfold, tweak as you go. The "what must be true" list is the watchlist.
- **You do not punish the founder for picking something imperfect.** Imperfect-and-chosen beats perfect-and-undecided every time.

The exchange the founder is making: take the discomfort of a bet they can't guarantee, in return for the clarity that lets their technical co-founder build the right thing. The reverse exchange — comfort now, fuzzy build for nine months — costs far more.

## Catching planning sneaking in

The founder will slip into planning language. Catch it every time:

| What they said | Why it's planning, not strategy | How to redirect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "We're going to hire two more salespeople." | Cost decision. You control it. | "What customer behavior does that create? What does the customer get that they didn't before?" |
| "We're going to launch a mobile app." | Activity, not bet. | "What changes for the customer? Why now? Why this segment specifically?" |
| "We're going to open an office in Bangalore." | Cost. | "What does the customer care about here? What does this enable on where-to-play or how-to-win?" |
| "We're going to improve onboarding." | Improvement is not a bet. | "*What* about onboarding? For whom? Producing what specific change in customer behavior?" |
| "Our strategy is to be AI-native." | Substrate, not strategy. | "AI is what your competitor uses too. What does *your use of AI* let you do that they can't?" |

For each activity the founder names, ask: *what is the strategic bet that backs this up?* If they cannot back it up, the activity is comfort, and it comes out of the strategy doc.

---

## The one-page output

When you are done, the founder should be able to write — and read back — a single page that captures:

```
WINNING ASPIRATION
  {one-sentence bet about what winning looks like, with a time horizon}

WHERE TO PLAY
  Customer:    {specific segment, named}
  Geography:   {specific, or "all" with reason}
  Channel:     {how the customer finds us}
  Scope:       {what's in — and crucially, what's out}

HOW TO WIN
  {one paragraph stating the right-to-win, drawn from the new defensibility list above — cost leadership, closed-loop flywheel, distribution, trust, network effects, proprietary data, depth of integration, or speed of iteration. NOT "more code" or "AI." Specific enough that a competitor reading it would be uncomfortable.}

CAPABILITIES REQUIRED
  - {capability 1 — essential, hard to copy}
  - {capability 2}
  - {capability 3}

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
  - {what we track weekly}
  - {the metric that tells us the strategy is working}
  - {the metric that tells us it isn't}

WHAT MUST BE TRUE
  About us:                     {1-2 lines}
  About the industry:           {1-2 lines}
  About competition:            {1-2 lines}
  About customers:              {1-2 lines}
  About our production economics: {1-2 lines}

  HOW WE'D KNOW IF SOMETHING ISN'T TRUE: {the signal — what to watch for}
```

If the founder cannot write this on one page, in plain English, and read each line back to you in their own words, the strategy is not yet locked.

---

## The read-it-back gate (strategy edition)

Before moving to the design doc, the founder must read back, **in their own words and without re-reading the chat**:

- Their winning aspiration
- Where they are choosing to play — *and* where they are explicitly not playing
- Their right to win in one sentence — and which defensibility category it comes from
- The single most important "what must be true" item across all five buckets, and what they would watch to know if it's true or breaking

If they cannot, the strategy is not yet shared understanding. Loop back.

---

## Technical Redirect Protocol — strategy edition

The founder may try to outsource strategic choices to the co-founder. Almost all of them are non-delegable:

| Strategic choice | Whose call | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Winning aspiration | Founder | The aspiration is a bet about market and customer. Not a build question. |
| Where to play | Founder | Customer / channel / scope is the business side. |
| How to win | Founder, with input from co-founder on what's buildable | The "right to win" is a customer claim. The co-founder can tell you what's hard to build, but cannot tell you what customers value. |
| Capabilities required | Founder names them; co-founder builds them | Naming is the strategic act. Building is execution. |
| Management systems | Founder | Knowing what to watch is the founder's job. The co-founder may set up dashboards. They don't choose the metric. |

If the founder tries to defer any of the above, hold the line. Pricing is not technical, distribution is not technical, who-the-customer-is is not technical — and where-to-play and how-to-win are not technical either.

---

## After the strategy is locked

Move to **Phase 5 — Drafting the Two Documents** (file `06_DESIGN_DOC.md`). The strategy becomes a section of `FOR_YOU.md`. The "what must be true" list becomes a weekly watchlist the founder uses with their technical co-founder to ask: *is the strategy still alive, or has the world told us something we should change?* The operating-model decisions (closed-loop, token-max, archetypes) become sections of `FOR_YOUR_CO_FOUNDER.md`.
